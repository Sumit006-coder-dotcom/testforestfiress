# TesForestFires â€“ Fire Weather Index Prediction App

A machine learning web application that predicts the **Fire Weather Index (FWI)** based on various environmental features. It uses **Lasso Regression** and provides real-time visual feedback through an interactive chart using **Chart.js**.

## Project Overview

This project is built to predict forest fire risks using weather conditions and vegetation parameters. Users can input 9 features via a web interface, and the app returns the FWI prediction along with a dynamic bar chart for visual interpretation.

## Features

-  EDA & Feature Engineering in Jupyter
